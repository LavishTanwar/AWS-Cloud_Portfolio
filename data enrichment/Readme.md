## 🔍 Objective

- Process semi-structured academic datasets (Snappy, CSV) using AWS Glue
- Query the transformed data using Amazon Athena
- Generate insights from structured and unstructured fields

  - 🔹 Location: `academics-trf-lok/academics/aca-semi-ds/User/`

### 2. **Glue Job Summary**
- No job graph shown here, but outputs confirm successful transformation and dual-format export (Snappy + CSV).

## 📊 Athena Querying & Analysis

### 1. **Faculty Performance Metrics**
- **Query:** `SELECT * FROM "faculty performance metrics";`
![image3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a16349a3-93ec-4ec9-b452-7ed60551c93e)

- **Insights:**
  - Schema includes `department`, `avg_teachingscore`, and `report_date_ltz`

### 2. **Sales and Customer Satisfaction Analysis**
- **Table:** `aca_prg_trf_system`
  ![image4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc8dc47a-1ea1-4301-b346-d0f8d07a37fc)

- **Key Columns:** `region`, `product`, `sales`, `unitsSold`, `profit`, `customerSatisfaction`

### 3. **Customer Feedback Dataset (Partitioned)**
- **Query:** `SELECT * FROM aca_prg_trf_system_5d0590e641147267c49f2ab541e1b220`
![image5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c002c1fb-ad3b-4d17-87ac-be02025ce068)

- **Key Columns:** `name`, `rating`, `comment`, `location`, `purchasetype`, `date`, `product`

## 💡 Summary & Learnings

- Data can be successfully ingested, processed, and transformed using AWS Glue.
- Using Athena, both numeric KPIs and qualitative feedback can be queried for deeper insights.
- Combining CSV + Parquet/Snappy formats helps optimize both performance and readability.

---

## ✅ Next Steps
- Add detailed comments for each Glue job visual in future weeks.
- Compare trends across weeks using combined Athena queries.
- Optional: Create Power BI/Tableau dashboard using Athena output.
