# Week 5 - AWS Cloud Portfolio Implementation

## ‚úÖ Overview

In Week 5, the focus was on **data enrichment** and **cost-efficient summarization** using AWS Glue and S3. This week's work expanded on earlier data preparation workflows by introducing **joins** between datasets and optimizing Glue job configurations for performance and cost analysis.

---

## üìå Objectives

- Enrich faculty and preliminary data using AWS Glue.
- Create consolidated datasets and output to multiple S3 targets.
- Analyze cost and performance of Glue job execution.
- Validate output schema in Glue Data Catalog.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Tasks & Activities

### 1. **Glue Job Creation: Faculty-Preliminary**
- Joined **Faculty** and **Preliminary** datasets using a **Join transform**.
- Combined data written to:
  - `/system/` directory on S3
  - `/User/` directory on S3
- Converted to single output file before writing to targets.

- S3 Outputs:

  - `academics-cur-lok/Faculty-Preliminary/User/`

### 2. **Data Summarization Cost Analysis**
- Tracked:
  - Number of Glue sessions
  - Job nodes used
  - Glue job duration per execution
- Created summary table:
Glue Iteration	Sessions	Nodes	Duration
Iteration 1	2	10	2.25 mins
Iteration 2	2	10	1.50 mins
Iteration 3	2	10	1.57 mins

### 3. **Schema Validatio![Uploading image2.png‚Ä¶]()
n**
- Verified schema under table: `faculty performance metrics`
- Located in Glue Data Catalog.
- Data stored in S3 path:  
  `s3://academics-cur-lok/faculty-performance/metrics/System/`
- Columns:
  - `department` (string)
  - `avg_teachingscore_#0` (double)
  - `report_date_ltz` (timestamp)
